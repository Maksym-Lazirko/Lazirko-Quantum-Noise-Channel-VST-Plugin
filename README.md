Quantum Noise Channel is an audio plugin that simulates a quantum noise in real time. It encodes the incoming audio into a quantum state and applies controllable dephasing and amplitude damping in Mono, Stereo, Mid‑Side, and Transient/Sustain modes. The resulting quantum noise and nonlinear behavior can be perceived as systemic combinations of soft clipping, compression‑like dynamics (driven by damping), and saturation with modulation (driven by dephasing). The plugin does not require quantum hardware, quantum computing is an analog process and this plugin simulates this!
